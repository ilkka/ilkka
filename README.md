I think of myself as half coder and technological explorer, half coach and peer support. I work mostly building list and detail views, as the joke goes, with web technologies. I work with clients in many different industries, building things both for consumers and for internal users.

Currently I'm trying to get better in Elixir, especially Phoenix LiveView, and Rust, although I'm a little bit more serious about the former.

If you want to talk about metal, aviation, cold war spy stories, pen and paper roleplaying games and hiking, hmu!
